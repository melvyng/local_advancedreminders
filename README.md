# moodle-local_advancedreminders
This plugin allows you to set up at the course level notifications with reminders if the participant is inactive or has activities pending completion.
You can set how many days are considered inactive, how many days a pending activity is considered, and when a reminder is resubmitted. You can edit the texts of notifications in all 4 languages.
